# MeMeApp

The original project had the following bugs:
On Rotation, the landscape will look be crunched together (not looking as good and cutting buttons off)
While taking picture or choosing, for any reason that action is not complete app will crash
The activities/layouts have no consistency (It's only a bug because there is specifications for layotu consistency)
