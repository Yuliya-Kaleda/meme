# MeMeApp

Pull request - june 12, 2015

Refactored code to use one activity and change layout views, Renamed some variables for easier identification. Was trying to work on logic of app so that if user has already uploaded an image, designed a meme, and then wants to switch the type of meme, they can do so without reselecting the image (still working on this)
